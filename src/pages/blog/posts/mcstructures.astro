        <h1>How to use .mcstructure files</h1>
        <hr>
    
        <p>Hello! It's time to put this blog to an actual good use</p>
    
        <p>If you have been on the Minecraft community for a while, specially the tech and map making communities you might have seen some files that end in .mcstructure and wondered what are they? And what are they used for? Today I hope to clear up both those things</p>
        
        <h2 id="what-are-mcstructures">What are .mcstructure files</h2>

        <p>A Minecraft structure file is a 3d model that is generated by the game to export structures for internal use (that's what they use to generate the vanilla structures) to share between people, create 3d renders and recently with the creation of structura they can also be used to transfer builds into survival</p>

        <h2 id="obtaining-files">Obtaining structure files</h2>

        <p>Mcstructure files can be obtained either through downloading them from the internet, for example on the bedrock storage tech discord, that has adopted them as a standard when submitting builds to challenges or to be archived, or through exporting them yourself with structure blocks</p>    

        <p>To do that you need to be in creative and get yourself a structure block with the command <code>/give @s strucutre_block</code>. You are then going to select your whole build, give it a name and click on the "export" button</p>

        <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523978560793477120/1110665255509557349/image.png">
        <h2 id="pasting-files">Pasting structure files in your creative worlds</h2>

        <p>Great! Now that we know what they are and how to obtain them, we can start to use them, I mentioned on the start that you can use them to share builds between people, so how do you do that? </p>

        <p>To paste an mcstructure into your world you first need to make it part of a behaviour pack, in this example the file will be named <code>house.mcstructure</code>, the easiest way to do that is to just use <a href="https://github.com/MRBBATES1/StructureImports/raw/main/StructureImports.mcaddon">this template</a> by MRBBATES1 to use it you need to import the mcaddon into your world and then go into the world files > behaviour_packs > the addon folder > structures and place your house.mcstructure file there</p>

        <p>Once you have done that you should be able to paste it with a structure block. In my example it would be named <span class="gradient-text">house</span> since my file name was <code>house.mcstructure</code> or with the <code>/structure</code> command with <code>/structure load house x y z 0_degrees none true true</code></p>

        <h2 id="using-structura">Transferring build to a survival world using Structura</h2>

        <p>Right, time to do it in survival now. To do that we will use a program called <span class="gradient-text">structura</span> it was made by Madd Hatter and can be found <a href="https://github.com/RavinMaddHatter/Structura/releases/">here</a>. To use it you need to have access to a computer, there are ways of doing it without one, I'll go on that later.</p>

        <p>Download the latest release of Structura from the releases page, unzip the file and run the executable. That should show you an app where you can give it a structure file and a pack name.</p>

        <img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523978560793477120/1110675328084475934/image.png">

        <p>Give it a file, a name and if you don't have already a material list you can click on make list to create one. After you have done that just click <code>Make Pack</code> and you should get a minecraft texture pack that replaces the armor stand model with a schematic of your build!</p>

        <p>But what if you don't have a computer to do run the python app in, you can use pydroid, tmux and some other apps to run it on your phone on android, but I find that a bit clunky so if you are on IOS or doesn't want to run the code yourself you can go on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/M7MHtUab2r">RavinMaddHatter's discord server</a> and use his discord bot.</p>

        <p>I think that covers everything, if you have any questions or suggestions you can find me on discord as <span class="gradient-text">R2leyser#0001</span></p>
